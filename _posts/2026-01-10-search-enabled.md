# Search Enabled: Powering The Custom Engine Blog with Algolia

We're excited to announce that **The Custom Engine** blog now features powerful search functionality powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)! 

## Why Search?

As our collection of technical samples, patterns, and best practices for Microsoft Copilot Studio continues to grow, we recognized the need for a faster, more intuitive way to help you find exactly what you're looking for. With nearly 30 blog posts covering everything from authentication patterns to MCP servers, agent-to-agent communication to custom knowledge sources, finding the right content quickly is now essential.

## What You Get

The new search feature provides:

- **Instant results as you type** - No need to press Enter or click search
- **Full-text search** - Search across titles, content, categories, and tags
- **Highlighted matches** - See exactly where your search terms appear
- **Rich result display** - View post titles, categories, tags, and content snippets
- **Smart ranking** - The most relevant results appear first
- **Typo tolerance** - Find what you need even with misspellings

## Try It Out

The search box is available on every page of the blog. Just start typing to see it in action! Try searching for:
- **"authentication"** - Find posts about SSO, OBO, and custom connectors
- **"A2A"** - Discover agent-to-agent communication patterns
- **"MCP"** - Explore Model Context Protocol integrations
- **"Foundry"** - Learn about Azure AI Foundry agent connections

## We Hope You Like It

We hope this enhancement makes your experience with **The Custom Engine** blog more productive and enjoyable. As we continue to publish technical content for Microsoft Copilot Studio, you can now find exactly what you need—fast.

Happy searching!
