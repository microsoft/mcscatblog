People keep asking me: *"Adi, how do I subscribe to the Custom Engine blog?"*

*"RSS, my friend. RSS."* At which point waves of nostalgia wash over them, harkening back to a time when the internet was a simpler place. But RSS is still relevant today! It lets you stay up to date and get the content YOU want.

Here's the feed URL for this blog:

**[{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml)**

Copy that URL and paste it into any RSS reader. Don't have an RSS reader yet? Wired has a great roundup of the best options: [The Best RSS Feed Readers](https://www.wired.com/story/best-rss-feed-readers/)

That's it. Pick a reader, add the feed, and you'll never miss a post about Copilot Studio, authentication, connectors, or any of the other topics we cover here.

See you in your feed reader! 🎉
